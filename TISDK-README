Create local branch

The below commit is used for this local branch and is the one used by
this sdk:
bbe8cfc1daae684faa5d82c2479fbcf9e9498641.

To reduce the size of the SDK installer only a portion of the git commit
history has been preserved. Also links to remote branches and tags do
not exist in this copy of the repository.
To fix this please run the unshallow-repositories.sh
script located in the sdk's bin directory

The script may take several minutes but you will then have a full copy of
the git repository including its entire git history.
