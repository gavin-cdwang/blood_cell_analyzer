OMAP OPP Exception Bindings
===========================

Certain boards may want to enable or disable OPPs for the MPU or other
devices based on the capabilities of the board itself. These bindings
allow any device node that has an operating-points property set or
receives its OPPs from elsewhere to selectively enable or disable
OPPs from a board dts.

Optional Properties
-------------------
- ti,opp-enable-exception: List of frequencies that represent valid
			   existing OPPs to be enabled regardless of
			   other conditions indicating that they should
			   be disabled.
- ti,opp-disable-exception: List of frequencies that represent valid
			    existing OPPs to be disabled regardless of
			    other conditions indicating that they should
			    be enabled.

Example
-------

        ti,opp-disable-exception = <300000>;
};
