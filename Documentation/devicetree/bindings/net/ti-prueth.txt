Required properties:
- compatible	: Should be one of the following,
		    "ti,am57-prueth" for AM57xx SoCs
		    "ti,am4372-prueth" for AM437x SoCs
		    "ti,am3359-prueth" for AM335x SoCs
- pruss		: Must point to the parent pruss device node
- sram		: pHandle to OCMC SRAM node

Must contain children, one for each of the MAC ports.
Required properties for children:
- phy-handle	: See ethernet.txt file in the same directory.
- phy-mode	: See ethernet.txt file in the same directory.
- sysevent-rx	: PRUSS Sysevent number for the RX event.

Optional properties for children:
- local-mac-address	: mac address for the port.

Example (am572x-idk board):

	pruss2_eth {
		compatible = "ti,am57-prueth";
		pruss = <&pruss2>;
		sram = <&ocmcram1>;

		pruss2_emac0: ethernet-mii0 {
			phy-handle = <&pruss2_eth0_phy>;
			phy-mode = "mii";
			sysevent-rx = <20>;	/* PRU_ARM_EVENT0 */
			/* Filled in by bootloader */
			local-mac-address = [00 00 00 00 00 00];
		};

		pruss2_emac1: ethernet-mii1 {
			phy-handle = <&pruss2_eth1_phy>;
			phy-mode = "mii";
			sysevent-rx = <21>;	/* PRU_ARM_EVENT1 */
			/* Filled in by bootloader */
			local-mac-address = [00 00 00 00 00 00];
		};
	};
