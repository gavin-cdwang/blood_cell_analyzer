SysCon Reset Controller
=======================

Almost all SoCs have hardware modules that require reset control in addition
to clock and power control for their functionality. The reset control is
typically provided by means of memory-mapped I/O registers. These registers are
sometimes a part of a larger register space region implementing various
functionalities. This register range is best represented as a syscon node to
allow multiple entities to access their relevant registers in the common
register space.

A SysCon Reset Controller node defines a device that uses a syscon node
and provides reset management functionality for various hardware modules
present on the SoC.

SysCon Reset Controller Node
============================
Each of the reset provider/controller nodes should have the following
properties.

Required properties:
--------------------
 - compatible	: Should be "syscon-reset"
 - syscon	: phandle to the syscon node containing the reset registers
 - #reset-cells	: Should be 6. Please see the reset consumer node below for
                  usage details

SysCon Reset Consumer Nodes
===========================
Each of the reset consumer nodes should have the following properties,
in addition to their own properties.

Required properties:
--------------------
 - resets	: A phandle and reset specifier pair, one pair for each reset
		  signal that affects the device, or that the device manages.
		  The phandle should point to the syscon node containing the
		  reset registers, and the reset specifier should have 6
		  cell-values. The reset specifier contains two similar pairs
		  of 3 cell-values each, the first of the pair containing the
		  reset control register information, and the second of the pair
		  containing the reset status register information. The reset
		  control and status registers can be same on some devices/SoCs.

		  Each of the pairs of 3 cell-values should have the following
		  values:
		     Cell #1 : register offset of the reset control/status
		               register from the syscon register base
		     Cell #2 : bit shift value for the reset in the respective
		               reset control/status register
		     Cell #3 : polarity of the reset bit. Should be 1 for resets
		               that are asserted when the bit is set, 0 for
		               resets that are asserted when the bit is cleared

Please also refer to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/reset/reset.txt for
common reset controller usage by consumers.


Example:
--------
The following example demonstrates a syscon node, the reset controller node
using the syscon node, and a consumer (a DSP device) on the TI Keystone 2
Hawking SoC.

/ {
	soc {
		psc: power-sleep-controller@02350000 {
			compatible = "syscon";
			reg = <0x02350000 0x1000>;
		};

		pscrst: psc-reset {
			compatible = "syscon-reset";
			syscon = <&psc>;
			#reset-cells = <6>;
		};

		dsp0: dsp0 {
			...
			resets = <&pscrst 0xa3c 8 0 0x83c 8 0>;
			...
		};
	};
};
